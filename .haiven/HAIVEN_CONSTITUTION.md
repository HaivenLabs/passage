# The Haiven Constitution

This document defines the shared product, engineering, architecture, quality, security, design, and AI-agent contribution rules for every Haiven product.

These are not preferences.

They are the baseline operating rules for the Haiven ecosystem.

Product repositories may add stricter product-specific rules, but they may not weaken these rules.

Heard, qurl, Passage, and every future Haiven product must be built as part of one coherent ecosystem, not as random one-off apps.

---

## 1. Ecosystem-first product development

Every Haiven product must be designed as part of the broader Haiven ecosystem.

Products should have clear boundaries, but they must not duplicate shared platform capabilities.

Required behavior:

- Shared identity belongs to Passage.
- Shared QR generation belongs to qurl.
- Shared contracts should be reused where practical.
- Shared design language should be reused where practical.
- Product-specific code should stay product-specific.
- Shared services should expose clean APIs and SDKs.
- Products should integrate through contracts, not private implementation details.

Definition of done:

- Product ownership is clear.
- Shared capabilities are not reimplemented inside product repos.
- Integration contracts are documented.
- Product-specific exceptions are documented.

---

## 2. Shared platform capabilities must be centralized

Haiven products must not repeatedly implement common platform capabilities.

If a capability is needed by more than one product, or is likely to become a reusable ecosystem primitive, it must be evaluated as a shared Haiven service before being implemented product-locally.

Shared platform candidates include:

- registration
- authentication
- identity
- account management
- tenant or workspace membership
- roles and permissions
- billing
- subscriptions
- notifications
- email/SMS provider abstraction
- QR generation
- audit logging
- telemetry
- design tokens
- admin shell primitives
- file/export services
- webhooks
- API client generation

Product repos may create temporary local implementations only when:

- the shared service does not exist yet
- the implementation is explicitly marked as temporary
- the implementation is wrapped behind a provider/client interface
- the contract matches the future shared service
- migration to the shared service is documented

No product may create a permanent local replacement for an existing Haiven shared service without a documented architecture exception.

Definition of done:

- Shared-service evaluation is documented for reusable capabilities.
- Temporary local implementations are behind interfaces.
- Migration path to the shared service is documented.
- Existing shared services are consumed instead of duplicated.

---

## 3. API-first

Every major capability must be accessible through stable APIs before it is tightly coupled to a UI.

The product UI, admin surfaces, mobile apps, integrations, automations, CLI tools, and future AI agents should operate on the same APIs.

Requirements:

- Public APIs use OpenAPI specifications unless a documented exception exists.
- OpenAPI contracts are the source of truth.
- Code generation is required where practical.
- Generated types, validation, clients, and server stubs should be derived from contracts.
- AI agents must modify contracts before implementation code when changing APIs.
- Internal service APIs use explicit contracts.
- APIs must support versioning.
- APIs must support pagination where listing is supported.
- APIs must support idempotency where duplicate creation or retries are plausible.
- APIs must return structured machine-readable errors.
- APIs must enforce tenant isolation and permissions.
- APIs must never expose unsafe internal implementation details.

Definition of done:

- OpenAPI spec updated.
- Generated code refreshed where practical.
- Contract compatibility validated.
- Contract tests included.
- API examples documented.
- Authentication and authorization enforced.
- Failure modes documented.

---

## 4. Contract-first

Canonical schemas and contracts must exist before implementation begins.

Schemas are the backbone of:

- APIs
- events
- persistence
- provider integrations
- exports
- webhooks
- AI workflows
- analytics
- open-source extensions

Requirements:

- All major entities use explicit versioned schemas.
- Schemas follow JSON Schema standards unless a documented exception exists.
- Breaking changes require schema version changes.
- Shared contracts must live in a dedicated contracts package or clearly named contract location.
- Arbitrary metadata must be intentionally scoped.
- Event payloads must be documented.
- Provider payload mappings must be documented.

Definition of done:

- Schema added or updated.
- Schema version documented.
- Validation tests included.
- Migration strategy documented where needed.

---

## 5. Modular monolith first

Haiven products should start as modular monoliths unless there is a clear operational reason not to.

The codebase must still use clear domain boundaries, contracts, events, providers, and package separation, but the first production system should be simple to run, debug, and self-host.

Preferred initial deployment shape:

- API server
- background worker
- web/admin app
- database
- optional local provider simulators

Rationale:

- Open-source contributors need a simple local development experience.
- Early deployments should be easy to run, debug, and self-host.
- Domain boundaries can be preserved without network boundaries.
- Services can be extracted later only when operational pressure justifies it.

Requirements:

- Domain packages must avoid circular dependencies.
- Cross-domain behavior should use interfaces, events, or application-layer orchestration.
- Database boundaries should be explicit even inside the monolith.
- Internal package contracts should be documented.
- No feature should require Kubernetes, service mesh, distributed tracing infrastructure, or paid cloud services to run locally.

Definition of done:

- Local development runs with a small number of processes.
- Module boundaries are documented.
- Future service extraction points are clear but not prematurely implemented.

---

## 6. Test-first development

Tests are a first-class deliverable.

AI agents and human contributors must not treat tests as optional cleanup work.

Requirements:

- Unit tests required for domain logic.
- Integration tests required for APIs.
- Contract tests required for providers and generated clients.
- Permission tests required for protected workflows.
- Multi-tenant isolation tests required for tenant-scoped products.
- Event emission tests required for event-driven behavior.
- Failure-mode tests required for critical workflows.
- Regression tests required for bug fixes.
- Critical user flows should be covered end-to-end.

Definition of done:

- Required tests pass.
- CI validates tests automatically.
- New functionality cannot merge without relevant tests.
- Important failure cases are tested, not merely happy paths.

---

## 7. Behavior-driven workflow validation

BDD-style scenarios should primarily drive integration and end-to-end workflow validation.

Unit tests should continue handling deterministic domain logic, validation, transformation, utility behavior, and isolated business rules.

BDD should focus on:

- multi-step workflows
- permission-sensitive operations
- event-driven orchestration
- guest or customer interaction flows
- account and registration flows
- provider integration behavior
- automation behavior

Preferred structure:

```gherkin
Given a known system state
When the user or system performs an action
Then the expected business outcome occurs
And the expected events, audit entries, and permissions are enforced
```

Requirements:

- High-value workflows include behavioral scenarios.
- Acceptance criteria must be testable.
- Behavioral tests should cover business-critical flows.
- Avoid heavyweight BDD for simple deterministic utility logic.

---

## 8. Event-driven architecture

Haiven products should communicate internally through explicit events instead of hidden coupling where the workflow benefits from asynchronous orchestration, auditability, retries, or downstream integrations.

Requirements:

- Events must be versioned.
- Events must be idempotent or safely de-duplicated.
- Events must support retries.
- Event contracts must be documented.
- Failed event delivery must be observable.
- Event consumers must be resilient to duplicate delivery.
- Event payloads must avoid unnecessary sensitive data.

Preferred infrastructure:

- Internal domain event dispatch plus transactional outbox initially.
- NATS adapter when async scale or deployment topology justifies it.
- Kafka-compatible future path only if enterprise scale requires it.

Definition of done:

- Event contract documented.
- Event emitted in the correct transaction or workflow boundary.
- Event tests included.
- Retry behavior validated.
- Failure behavior observable.

---

## 9. Transactional outbox and consistency

Haiven products must guarantee consistency between durable database state changes and emitted domain events when events are used to drive downstream behavior.

Preferred pattern:

- Transactional outbox.

Requirements:

- Domain events are persisted in the same transaction as the originating state change.
- Background workers publish queued outbox events.
- Event publication must support retries.
- Event publication failures must be observable.
- Event consumers must support idempotency.
- Outbox replay tooling must exist for production systems.
- Outbox records must include enough metadata for debugging and safe replay.

Definition of done:

- State change and outbox insert occur atomically.
- Event publication is observable.
- Replay and retry behavior are tested.

---

## 10. Multi-tenant by default where applicable

Every product that supports organizations, businesses, teams, customers, workspaces, brands, or accounts must be tenant-aware from the beginning.

Tenant isolation cannot be retrofitted later without risk.

Requirements:

- Tenant-scoped records include tenant identifiers.
- Authorization checks enforce tenant boundaries.
- Cross-tenant access is prohibited by default.
- Queries must be tenant-scoped.
- Exports must be tenant-scoped.
- Audit logs must preserve tenant context.
- Background workers and async jobs must preserve tenant context.
- Cross-tenant queries require explicit privileged service behavior.

Preferred strategy:

- PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for tenant-scoped production tables where practical.
- Application-level tenant context enforcement.
- Repository/query-layer tenant injection.
- Service-level authorization checks.

Definition of done:

- Tenant isolation tests included.
- Permission tests included.
- Unsafe queries blocked by linting, review, or repository patterns.
- RLS coverage documented where used.

---

## 11. Canonical identity and identifiers

Core platform identifiers must use UUIDs unless there is a deliberate, documented exception.

Requirements:

- Tenant IDs must be UUIDs.
- Internal entity IDs should be UUIDs.
- External provider IDs must be stored separately from internal IDs.
- External IDs must never be treated as globally unique without source-system and tenant/location/context.
- Database primary keys should use UUIDs for tenant-scoped domain entities.
- Public URLs should use opaque tokens or slugs instead of exposing raw UUIDs when appropriate.

Definition of done:

- Internal ID fields use UUIDs unless documented otherwise.
- External ID mappings are stored separately.
- ID semantics are documented in schemas.

---

## 12. Passage owns shared identity

Passage is the shared Haiven registration, authentication, identity, account, session, tenant, role, and permission platform.

Haiven products must not each invent their own auth stack.

Passage owns:

- registration
- login
- account creation
- sessions
- identity profiles
- anonymous-to-account handoff
- tenant or workspace membership
- roles
- permissions
- auth provider integrations
- OAuth/OIDC/passkey/passwordless strategy as applicable
- developer integration SDKs for Haiven products

Product repos own:

- product-specific authorization decisions
- product-specific permission checks
- product-specific user experience after identity is resolved
- product-specific account onboarding where Passage delegates context

Requirements:

- Production admin surfaces require authentication.
- Third-party identity providers should be pluggable through provider abstractions.
- Role and tenant scoping must be enforced after authentication.
- Local development may use a clearly labeled auth bypass only in non-production environments.
- Product repos must integrate with Passage through documented contracts.

Definition of done:

- Product auth paths use Passage or a temporary documented adapter.
- Role and tenant checks are enforced for authenticated requests.
- Local auth bypass cannot run in production mode.
- Product-specific permissions are tested.

---

## 13. qurl owns shared QR generation

qurl is the shared QR generation product in the Haiven ecosystem.

Haiven products must not implement their own QR rendering engines unless a temporary local fake is required for tests or offline development.

qurl owns:

- QR code rendering
- QR export formats
- QR styling
- QR asset generation
- QR payload encoding rules
- QR design studio
- QR templates
- hosted dynamic QR behavior when explicitly selected
- scan analytics when explicitly selected

Product repos own:

- product context
- destination URL creation
- opaque token generation
- permissions
- product-specific analytics
- product workflow tied to the destination URL

Integration rule:

- The product generates the destination URL.
- The product sends that destination URL to qurl.
- qurl returns QR assets or downloadable QR representations.
- The product stores the qurl asset reference if needed.
- The product should not send unnecessary tenant, customer, guest, order, or operational metadata to qurl.

Direct QR rule:

If a user creates a direct QR code for `https://example.com`, the QR code points to `https://example.com`.

No surprise short links.

No forced redirect domains.

No tracking unless the user explicitly chooses it.

Definition of done:

- Product has a qurl provider/client interface.
- Local development has a fake qurl provider if qurl is unavailable.
- Production configuration can point to a real qurl API.
- QR generation tests verify minimal data sharing.
- Product does not add a separate QR rendering library except for local fakes or tests.

---

## 22. Unified responsive experience standard

Haiven products must ship one premium responsive interface system across guest-facing, customer-facing, and admin-facing surfaces instead of maintaining separate device-specific variants.

Requirements:

- UI work must be mobile-first and scale cleanly to tablet, laptop, and desktop layouts.
- Separate iOS, Android, tablet, or desktop variants are discouraged unless a platform constraint makes them unavoidable.
- Shared layout primitives, spacing rules, typography, and component patterns should support all supported screen sizes.
- Production UX must meet a high visual bar.
- Interfaces must be screenshot-ready from the first usable slice.
- Responsive behavior is part of the feature, not deferred polish.

---

## 25. Vertical slice delivery

Features should be built as complete end-to-end vertical slices.

Avoid:

- building all database tables first
- building all APIs first
- building all UIs first
- giant incomplete architectural layers
- disconnected scaffolding that cannot prove user value

Preferred approach:

- Every task includes testing expectations.
- Every task includes observability requirements.
- Every task includes permission expectations.
- Every task includes failure-mode handling.
- Generated code must remain readable.
- Generated code must not bypass contracts.
- Generated code must not invent architecture that conflicts with this constitution.
- New durable directives that change product, UX, architecture, quality, or implementation expectations must be written back into the relevant docs instead of living only in chat context.
- When user feedback identifies UX confusion or workflow friction, the plan should be updated with concrete interaction requirements before subsequent implementation continues.

Preferred task structure:

- Goal
- User story
- Scope
- API contract
- Data model
- Events emitted
- Permissions
- Failure modes
- Observability
- Tests required
- Definition of done

---
